<p title="Content">Agarwood, aloeswood, eaglewood, gharuwood or the Wood of Gods, most commonly referred to as oud or oudh (from Arabic: عود, romanized: ʿūd, pronounced [ʕuːd]), is a fragrant dark resinous wood used in incense, perfume, and small carvings. <br>It is formed in the heartwood of Aquilaria trees when they become infected with a type of mould (Phialophora parasitica) and secrete a resin to combat the mould. Prior to infection, the heartwood is odourless, relatively light and pale coloured; <br>however, as the infection progresses, the tree produces a dark aromatic resin, called aloes (not to be confused with Aloe ferox, the succulent commonly known as the bitter aloe) or agar (not to be confused with the edible, algae-derived agar) as well as gaharu, jinko, oud, or oodh aguru, in response to the attack, which results in a very dense, dark, resin-embedded heartwood. The resin-embedded wood is valued in East and South Asian cultures for its distinctive fragrance, and thus is used for incense and perfumes.</p> <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agarwood"> Agrwood wikipedia</a>

Plans for human spaceflight began in the U.S. Armed Forces prior to NASA's creation. 
The Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and the Army's Project Adam served as the foundation for Project Mercury, 
the first American program to put people in space. 
NASA established the Space Task Group to manage the program,
which would conduct sub-orbital flights with the Army's Redstone rockets and orbital flights with the Air Force's Atlas launch vehicles. 
While NASA intended for its first astronauts to be civilians, President Eisenhower directed that they be selected from the military. 
The Mercury 7 astronauts included three Air Force pilots, three Navy aviators, and one Marine Corps pilot.</pre>
